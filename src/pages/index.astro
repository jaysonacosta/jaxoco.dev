				I am a 22 year old software developer and I love telling computers what
				to do. My interests include web development (React) and setting up a
				perfect environment on my computer.

				I'm always working or learning something. Check out my GitHub for a
				quick glance at some of the things I've created (not promising
				everything will be jaw dropping). Below are some of my prouder works.
